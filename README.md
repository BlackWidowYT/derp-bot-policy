# **[Privacy Policy of Derp Discord Bot](blackwidowdev.fun)**

We are **Derp**


---

## **What information is stored?**

Important info is stored.

## Why it is stored?
We store it for check what our users are doing with our bot, because we can have bugs, issues and we need to know it.

## How it is stored?
We use an database for it. We store it in our Mongo Database for the security of us and our users.

## Who can see my data?
Since it is stored in internal cache memory of bot, no one can see it until someone uses `derp snipe` command to view deleted message in that specific guild channel.

## How can I delete my Data?
Well, since we're not using any database, it's stored in internal cache memory of bot, so practically not possible to "delete". But you can contact me & I will disable storing of message content & snipe command in your server.
